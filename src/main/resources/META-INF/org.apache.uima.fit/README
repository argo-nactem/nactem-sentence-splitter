UIMAFIT TYPE SYSTEM DETECTION 

The META-INF/org.apache.uima.fit/types.txt file contains the paths to the XML descriptor files,
defining the UIMA type systems, used by this component.

It is required by uimaFit to automatically detect type systems when running a pipeline.

Ideally each JAR file containing type system descriptors should include a types.txt file, pointing
to the descriptors in that JAR file, to avoid having to declare a types.txt file within a component.

The type systems available in Argo do not have types.txt files yet, hence the need for this file here.
